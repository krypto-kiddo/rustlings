// Still can't figure out why is it better to name constants as upper case...

// Update: Found something. 
// Its more of a habbit than of any technical use.
// This comes from naming constants as UPERCASE in C#
// Which, actually comes from the habbit of naming preprocessor macros in upper case. 
// They did it because reading preprocessor macros was not really easy.
